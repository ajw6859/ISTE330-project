BOOKS DATABASE
Jim Habermas
The project is based on a book database system pertaining to various needs of the user. 
The basic interface involves querying books according to language, title, author, publisher, ISBN. 
We support services for buying and selling used books or books used in specific IIT Kanpur courses.
We build a personal profile page which is used for handling the transactions between various students.
We implement a "recommendation system" for recommending books to be used in a particular course in addition
to their availability in the library. The system gives advice for cheap used books available at the time, when 
that book is not found in the library.
